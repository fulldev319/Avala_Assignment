Generalist SWE Take Home Challenge
- Take as long as you like, but if you’re going to take longer than a week, please let us know.
- Use any language or technology you like, and deliver the source code (not an executable) by any means you like.
- Feel free to choose a focus area if you feel it will better showcase your skills.

We’d like you to write us a program that:
• Generates 8-digit hexadecimal codes to be used for 2FA.

The rules are as follows:
1. Every time you run the program, it should emit one 8-digit hexadecimal code;
2. It should emit every possible code before repeating;
3. It should not print "odd-looking" codes such as 0xAAAAAAAA or 0x01234567 or any commonly used words, phrases, or hexspeak such as 0xDEADBEEF;
4. Codes should be emitted in apparently random order.
If we like what we see, we will invite you to a call to conduct a code review of your program.
